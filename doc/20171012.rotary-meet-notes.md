#12-Oct-17 Rotary Meeting Notes

Going over my notes from last TH.

## Some decisions
- We decided to not design for mobile since Fred won't be using it and we could always to so in phase 2 if we want ant there is one.

- We decided to add an 'active' field to the member's table. Members are active (true) by default and when inactive (false) they are considered deleted

- Michael will change the paths on the members route so that setting a member to inactiv is an update not a delete.

## Member UI notes
- needs a 'sav' button
- add comment & phone fields
- change the delete button to have an archive button
- add a clean/dirty flag to redux so that when edit mode we know if anyting has changed

## New Member UI
- save as "member' in edit mode
- change on/off to yes/no
- exempt defaults to No
- all exceptions default to Yes
- does not have an edit or archive button
- needs a clean/dirty flag

## Schedule UI
- The fields will be ...
  - role, member name, last served date, last role name, served, comment, contact(button)
  - the last field is a button that brings-up the members contact details
- We decide that we need to support past dates and that future dates are possible but postpone coding that until we see how long other features take us.
- has save, cancel and change date functionality


I'll see if I have time to update the mock-up
